# EasyTweeter
EasyTweeter is a simple and easy to use one-file Python library which automates almost all of Twitter bot construction for simple bots which just post tweets and don't do much (or any) interaction with followers, other than notifying the bot's owner that it is being interacted with.

It is built on top of [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org).

EasyTweeter is available on pip: `pip install EasyTweeter`
